# Vue Learning Project

This project is for learning and experimenting with Vue.js concepts.

## About

I created this project as a sandbox to understand and try out various Vue features and usages:

- Vue instance and syntax
- Templates and data binding
- Directives like v-model, v-for etc
- Computed properties
- Components
- Props
- Events and event bus
- Lifecycle hooks
- Routing
- State management with Vuex
- AJAX calls and APIs

The project contains basic examples and samples for the above concepts implemented in individual branches.

## Usage

Clone the project, checkout a branch like "v-model", and open the HTML files in the browser to see the examples.

## Goals

My aim is to get hands-on experience with Vue to understand:

- How reactive data flows and binds to DOM
- Reusability and composition with components
- Handling user input, events and communication
- Managing state with central store
- Building declarative UIs in a modular fashion
- Vue CLI and single file components
- Unit testing Vue components

This will serve as a good foundation before building more real-world apps.
